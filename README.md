Fantastic 6 is a community-based financing platform for Canadian freelancers

**Tech Jam Inspiration**

What inspired us was the untapped potential and the trend f the gig economy. We realized through our research that a lot of freelancers struggle financially. We also noticed that a lot of companies such as Uber and Doordash have tapped into this and created convenient solutions for people. However, there is no platform that brings these people together and gives them the opportunity to network, learn, and invest in each other. We faced challenges in our design process but we ultimately overcame this challenge to create a user-friendly website and application.
